This faction is highly fragmented, with many, many different subfactions, such as the Vivadian Wonderers. These factions range from peaceful monks, to traveling war tribes. They exist both within the city, and without.</p>

                     <p>&nbsp;An abysmal lack of ethics, and disregard of law and order. LEAGUE has set themselves in stone as an organization built on the ideals of securing a future of perfection and prosperity of strictly themselves. Hidden behind a strict code of anonymity, LEAGUE is built up of perhaps a hundred of wealthy Middle-Weight citizens. It prides itself on infiltration and ruthless attacks directed at its competition.&nbsp;</p>

Employees that have showed excellent performance and are officially deemed worthy to be under one member of LEAGUE. Directly serving the work given to them. Usually, when a job is needed, random street thugs or lethal citizens are recruited with an objective, a reward, and disposable tools depending on its needs. Sometimes assignments are more long-time and sophisticated. Such as climbing a corporate ladder and ending other Businessmen when they’d least expect it. Pets are usually allowed to meet and or attend meetings between LEAGUE members. As they are more or less an official member of the group itself. Though, rats and less reliable ones are excluded from meetings.</p>

Or even taking them out personally. Sub-Groups have formed, but nothing has been as prosperous and organized as LEAGUE itself. LEAGUE was formed multiple years after RAPTURE established Shiloh, after businesses rose and classes divided, the worms and immoral blank faced suits grouped together in a borderline crime syndicate, carrying out bloody operations to keep money flowing.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Like a triangle.

They are a volunteer force, with the exception of clan troops being donated and integrated into the Defence Force. This is their downfall, as constant bickering over what the ADF is supposed to be and does, keeps it from expanding out into the wasteland. Conflicting interests of the different clans keeps the system in Gridlock.<br><br>Many think that the ADF become independent, and form a temporary military junta to wait out the storm of RAPTURE. Others think that clan rule keeps the ADF from forming into an Authoritarian regime, like the one found in Shiloh. Whatever the future that lays ahead there will still be soldiers marching down the streets to protect those who cannot protect themselves.</p>
