                     <p>Hovercraft technology is widely employed by RAPTURE for fast moving VTOL Ships of different uses. Many dropships that land soldiers use VTOL Hovercraft technology to lift off and land smoothly. Hovercraft works by rapulsing matter beneath it so much, it applies force in the direction the engine is facing. It creates an ultra smooth ride, better than any vehicles state of the art suspension.</p>

                     <p>RAPTURE also employs this into their more rare species of Armor and Mechanized crafts, hovering over the ground to avoid the difficult terrain. This allows for larger vehicles to move at the same speed as smaller, lightly armored vehicles. On a smaller scale, a few wealthy elites could ride in Hovercars in Middle-Weight, and Patrol Cars employed the PD are looking into applying this technology to their vehicles as well.</p><p>Vehicles in the Wasteland usually rely on Old-World technology, that being standard rubber wheels. Not many vehicles have been salvaged from RAPTURE with intact hovercraft technology</p><p>‚Å†</p>

                     <p>Railgun weaponry relies on accelerating iron between two electromagnets and sending them out at an extremely high velocity. Railguns can be found at all sizes, to small handguns that shoot even smaller cones, to large cannons that fire large cylinders that turn into slag upon impact.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Railguns are a tradeoff, bulkier weapons that need a charge for a higher capacity of smaller ammunition. Railguns come in all sorts of calibres, and even today, people argue what the best shape and size of ammunition to use in them.<br></span><br>Most railguns have settings, which exchange power for muzzle velocity. A max power setting will expend all the current charge in a Railgun, sending the metal spike at ludicrous speeds and piercing most armor, unless it has amazing heat-dispersal technology. A lower setting will underpower the magnets, sending a projectile with the piercing power of a .22 rifle.

                     <p>Laser Weaponry has three modes: Pulse Lasers, Scatter Lasers, and Beam Lasers. Pulse Lasers operate like any assault rifle would, sending many projectiles of light towards an enemy, with some degree of spread. Pulse Lasers tend to have the least effect per individual laser, but make for a good replacement of Kinetic Weapons in the sense of zero physical material is needed, just enlarged battery packs.
</p><p>Scatter Lasers are purely for the replacement of Combat Shotguns, effectively nicknamed Scatterguns by those who have seen them and lived. These fire a large burst of lasers, through a kaleidoscope-like lens, then focused towards a general direction. The target will have a large burn whole wherever a majority of these land.
</p><p>Finally, Beam Lasers. These pack a punch, but require an immense amount of power to keep firing. High Caliber Rifles, Tank Turrets, and AT Launchers all can be replaced with these. They will punch a hole through loads of armor, lest it has top of the line-heat dispersal. However, they take forever to charge, and currently rely on fast thinking or a surprise attack to get the best effect.

Anything goes.</p><p>Sentient Robotics aren't introspective, as in, they cannot make their code more efficient or gain a higher degree of intelligence via constantly working on their very owb core code. They are undying, but usually require a way to charge and gain power.<br><br>Robots in Shiloh usually have a backdoor for RAPTURE, in the case of an emergency. Otherwise, they are treated like standard citizens. Citizen-Robot tension is high, however, due to RAPTURE's own robotic nature, taking over the world.</p>

                     <p><br><br><br>&nbsp; Old-world 3D Printing was just the tip of the iceberg, and it soon became the industry standard, it started off with small objects and grew bigger and bigger, and now things of many sizes and materials are constructed in A3D Printing Factories.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

                     <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For example, all of the many things are researched and prototyped within the Data-Hive, and A3D Printing this bleeding edge technology enables RAPTURE to equip itself on the fly. And in the case it is destroyed, much of the material can be salvaged and reused in the construction of another one, provided no chemical changes have occurred.<br><br>&nbsp;A wide variety of items are created in A3D Printers, such as weaponry, household furniture, and even other vehicles, such as cars. It is possible to have material in ones home to print simple items. Material can be bought at various stores and used at your own household. However, these printers are still wildly expensive, and many families in Outer-Edge can‚Äôt afford them, forcing them to buy said goods in a store.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; People in the Wasteland cold only ever dream of acquiring themselves an A3D Printer. Nearly all of them were destroyed or captured in the Awakening, and even if they found a working A3D Printer, there is still the challenge of finding the compatible material to use in it</p>

                     <p>While Cybernetics haven't come far, due to RAPTURE‚Äôs lack of interest in it, and the slow research speed of the Old-World. However, it still exists, to a minor extent. Arms and legs can be replaced, as well as the heart, lungs, eyes, and stomache, with a cybernetic replacement.</p><p><br></p>

                     <p>These will mimic the old functions, but enhancements are incredibly rare. Eyes are the cheapest object to enhance, with aesthetic features like changing the color of irises, or with functionality like a limited zoom up to 2.5x. Arms cannot be modified extensively, barring tools being embedded in fingers or small electronics embedded in the forearms.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; These are also incredibly hard to find out in the wastes, and many bandits out in the wastes will butcher people to find and take any prosthesis they may have.</span><br></p>
